# About Ink

An overview of Ink’s high level architecture, including the fact that it is a vanilla instance of the OP stack, that its EVM compatible, open source, and conforms the Superchain’s law of chains.

## What is Ink?

Ink is a cutting-edge Layer 2 (L2) blockchain built on Optimism’s Superchain and released by Kraken. As a natural evolution of Kraken's mission, Ink serves as a seamless bridge to Decentralized Finance (DeFi), empowering users to move onchain with confidence and ease. 
Ink integrates Kraken's unique strengths as a core crypto exchange and embodies its vision of pushing the boundaries of financial freedom.
In order to accomplish this Ink will:  
- Wield a strong focus on DeFi powered by Kraken's existing infrastructure and featuring asset wrappers, tokenization, yield opportunities and more advanced financial products.
- Leverage Kraken's industry-leading expertise in security and reliability in order to safeguard and uplift users.
