## What do I Need to Start Developing on Ink?
1. An editor (with a Solidity highlighting package) like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to efficiently write smart contract code. This code will need the be compiled before deployment; see Step 4.
2. A web3 wallet that holds funds to transact and deploy blockchain code such as [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet)
3. Testnet funds to fund your transactions (see [Get Testnet Funds](/quick-start/faucets))
4. Recommended: a development framework like [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to streamline smart contract development. 
    - You will need the private key to your wallet account to deploy through these frameworks.
    - These frameworks can also take care of code compilation for you - otherwise you will need a standalone [solution](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html).
5. If you want to deploy code to the blockchain through the browser instead, a web3 browser extension (most web3 wallets will have one)

As an alternative to most of the above you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), but you will still need a web3 wallet browser extension with funds to deploy your code.

## Connecting to Ink

In order to deploy code to Ink, you need a blockchain wallet that has funds in it in order to pay the deployment cost of the code. The easiest way of getting set up is by:
1. Creating a wallet
2. Connecting the wallet to the Ink chain
3. Getting funds to use on Ink from a [faucet](https://https://docs.inkonchain.com/quick-start/faucets) or by [bridging]()

###### Creating a Wallet
1. Get a wallet from [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet), [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/en-us/) or many more. 
    - Make sure your wallet is EVM compatible i.e. works with Ethereum-based chains. The ones mentioned above do. 
    - Use the browser extension of the wallet you chose to simplify deploying code.
2. Set up your wallet, which will include writing down a mnemonic (a set of words) and getting an address that starts with "0x".

###### Connecting Metamask Wallet to Ink Sepolia (Testnet)

In order to connect your wallet to Ink you must add Ink Sepolia as a custom network. Note that your wallet should be EVM-compatible.

    1. Open your Metamask browser extension.
    2. Open the network selection dropdown menu by clicking the dropdown button at the top left of the extension.
    3. Click the "+ Add network" button at the bottom.
    4. A new window should open. Click "Add a network manually" at the bottom of the list.
    5. In the dialog that appears, enter the information listed in [Network Information](#network-information). See screenshot below.
    6. Click "Save".
    7. When clicking on the network selection dropdown you can now select Ink Sepolia to connect to.

Next: get some [play money](#faucet) from our faucets!

###### Fund your Wallet
Get fake Ether (ETH) from these faucets so you can fund your wallet to send transactions and deploy contracts on Ink Sepolia.

Check out faucets [here](https://docs.inkonchain.com/quick-start/faucets). Alternatively, you can [bridge](https://docs.inkonchain.com/quick-start/faucets#bridging-funds-to-ink-sepolia) testnet funds.
