## Fund your Sepolia Ink Chain Account

To get funds into your account, make sure to follow the steps below:

1. If you don't already own some SepoliaETH, make sure to get some from one of the available faucets
2. Once you have your SepoliaETH deposited into your account, send the amount you wish to bridge to the [`L1StandardBridge`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xC0d337f71aD19a8f17a1b297cDb3a86c5EEf9Eec). The op-node will automatically pick up the L1 transactions and process them in the L2 state, which means you should soon see your SepoliaETH bridged over to InkChain.
