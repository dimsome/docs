## Verifying your Smart Contract 

In order for your deployed smart contract(s) to be human-readable on block explorers like Blockscout they must be verified. Verification is highly recommended to increase trust in your code and dapp.

Smart contracts can be [verified through the Blockscout UI](https://docs.blockscout.com/devs/verification/blockscout-ui) or a [host of other methods](https://docs.blockscout.com/devs/verification).
