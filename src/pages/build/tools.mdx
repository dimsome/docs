## Bridges

Users can send ETH from other chains to Ink Seplia using bridges.

###### Bridge ETH manually using the canonical bridge contract

"Canonical" here means that the bridge can be reached at the same address no matter what chain.

1. Ensure you are connected to a chain where you have testnet Ether different from Ink Sepolia.
2. Send Ether from your wallet to canonical bridge address: 0x...
3. Once the transaction is confirmed, switch to Ink Sepolia and you should see the bridged Ether.

###### Bridge ETH using Kraken's interface
