# Faucet

Sorry folks, no faucet available yet. However, this is how you get ETH on Ink Sepolia:

1. Get ETH from one of the existing faucets on the Ethereum Sepolia network

- https://console.optimism.io/faucet
- https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
- https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia
- https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia

2. Transfer your ETH to `0xC0d337f71aD19a8f17a1b297cDb3a86c5EEf9Eec`. This is the [`L1StandardBridge Contract`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xC0d337f71aD19a8f17a1b297cDb3a86c5EEf9Eec). The Ink op-node will automatically pick up the L1 transactions and process them in the L2 state, which means you should soon see your SepoliaETH bridged over to InkChain.
